   """
    Applies the learning process of a population of genomes using selection, crossover, mutation, and activation function potentiation.
    The function modifies the population's weights and activation functions based on a specified policy, mutation probabilities, and strategy.

    Args:
        weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of weights for each genoms. (first returned value of define_genomes function)
        activation_potentiations (list): A list of activation functions for each genomes. (second returned value of define_genomes function)
        what_gen (int): The current generation number, used for informational purposes or logging.
        y_reward (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array containing the fitness or reward values of each genome. The array is used to rank the genomes based on their performance. And PLANEAT maximize the reward.
        show_info (bool, optional): If True, prints information about the current generation and the maximum reward obtained. Also shows current configuration. Default is False.
        \n strategy (str, optional): The strategy for combining the best and bad genomes. Options: \n
                                  - 'cross_over': Perform Two-Point Matrix Crossover between the best genomes and replace bad genomes. (Classic NEAT cross over)\n
                                  - 'potentiate': Cumulate the weight of the best genomes and replace bad genomes. (PLAN feature. 'Like Arithmetic Crossover but different.')\n
                                  Default is 'cross_over'.
        \n policy (str, optional): The selection policy that governs how genomes are selected for reproduction. Options: \n
                                 - 'normal_selective': Normal selection based on reward, where a portion of the bad genes are discarded.\n
                                 - 'more_selective': A more selective policy, where fewer bad genes survive.\n
                                 - 'less_selective': A less selective policy, where more bad genes survive.\n
                                 Default is 'normal_selective'.\n
        mutations (bool, optional): If True, mutations are applied to the bad genomes and potentially to the best genomes as well. Default is True.
        bad_genoms_mutation_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the bad genomes. Must be in the range [0, 1]. Also effects best genoms mutatation prob. For example 0.7 value for bad genoms then 0.3 value for best genoms. Default is None, which means it is determined by the `policy` argument.
        activation_mutate_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the activation functions. Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5 (% 50)
        save_best_genom (bool, optional): If True, ensures that the best genome are saved and not mutated or altered during reproduction. Default is True.

    Raises:
        ValueError: 
            - If `policy` is not one of the specified values ('normal_selective', 'more_selective', 'less_selective').
            - If `bad_genoms_mutation_prob` or `activation_mutate_prob` are not in the range [0, 1].
            - If the population size is odd (ensuring an even number of genomes is required for proper selection).

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - weights (numpy.ndarray): The updated weights for the population after selection, crossover, and mutation. 
                                      The shape is (population_size, output_shape, input_shape).
            - activation_potentiations (list): The updated list of activation functions for the population.

    Notes:
        - **Selection Process**: 
            - The genomes are sorted by their fitness (based on `y_reward`), and then split into "best" and "bad" half. 
            - The best genomes are retained, and the bad genomes are modified based on the selected strategy.
            
        - **Crossover and Potentiation Strategies**:
            - The **'cross_over'** strategy performs crossover, where parts of the best genomes' weights are combined with the other good genomes to create new weight matrices.
            - The **'potentiate'** strategy strengthens the best genomes by potentiating their weights towards the other good genomes.
            
        - **Mutation**:
            - Mutation is applied to both the best and bad genomes, depending on the mutation probability and the `policy`.
            - `bad_genoms_mutation_prob` determines the probability of applying mutations to the bad genomes.
            - If `activation_mutate_prob` is provided, activation function mutations are applied to the genomes based on this probability.
            
        - **Policy Types**:
            - **'normal_selective'**: A typical selection policy where a portion of the bad genomes is discarded. The mutation probability for the bad genomes is set to 0.7 by default.
            - **'more_selective'**: A stricter selection policy where more of the bad genomes are discarded. The mutation probability for the bad genomes is set to 0.85 by default.
            - **'less_selective'**: A more lenient selection policy where fewer bad genomes are discarded. The mutation probability for the bad genomes is set to 0.6 by default.
            
        - **Population Size**: The population size must be an even number to properly split the best and bad genomes. If `y_reward` has an odd length, an error is raised.
        
        - **Logging**: If `info=True`, the current generation and the maximum reward from the population are printed for tracking the learning progress.

    Example:
        ```python
        weights, activation_potentiations = learner(weights, activation_potentiations, 1, y_reward, info=True, strategy='cross_over', policy='normal_selective')
        ```

    - The function returns the updated weights and activations after processing based on the chosen strategy, policy, and mutation parameters.

        tuple: A tuple containing:

            - new_activations (list): The new activation functions after concatenation.
    
    Notes:
        - The weight matrices are element-wise added and then normalized using the `normalization` function. (Max abs normalization.)
        - The activation functions from both parents are concatenated to form the new activation functions list.
        - If the activation functions are passed as strings, they are converted to lists for uniform handling.
