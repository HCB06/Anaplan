--- UPDATE 2.4.7 ---

* Three new hyperparameters were added to the learner function in the planeat module: 'activation_selection_add_prob', 'activation_selection_change_prob', and 'activation_selection_rate'. Details are available in the docstring and the updated documentation.
* Bug fixes in the planeat module.
* The cross_over function in the planeat module was optimized.
* The default values of the 'activation_add_prob' and 'activation_delete_prob' hyperparameters in the learner function of the planeat module have been changed to 0.5.

--- UPDATE 2.4.6 ---

* Doctrings updated.
* Documentation updated: https://github.com/HCB06/Anaplan/blob/main/Welcome_to_Anaplan/ANAPLAN_USER_MANUEL_AND_LEGAL_INFORMATION(EN).pdf

--- UPDATE 2.4.5 ---

* Bug fixes in planeat module.
* planeat modules learner function have new hyperparameters:
  - activation_add_prob=0.9, activation_delete_prob=0.1, activation_change_prob=0.5, weight_mutate_prob=1, weight_mutate_rate=32

--- UPDATE 2.4.3 ---

* Bug fix in planeat module for 'cross_over_mode' hyperparameter.


--- UPDATE 2.4.2 ---

* A new hyperparameter called 'cross_over_mode' has been added to the learner function in the planeat module.
* More PLAN-like features have been added in planeat module. These are some of the weight features used for non-linearity of the PLAN algorithm to create more powerful models.


--- UPDATE 2.4.1 ---

* A new hyperparameter called 'show_info' has been added to the save_model function in the model_operations module and it no longer returns anything.
* Bug fixes in planeat module.


--- UPDATE 2.4 ---

* ANAPLAN documentation updated. Includes new modules and planeat module.
