--- UPDATE 2.5.7 Yanked ---
--- UPDATE 2.5.6 Yanked ---
--- UPDATE 2.5.5 Yanked ---
--- UPDATE 2.5.4 Yanked ---

--- UPDATE 2.5.3 ---

--- UPDATE 2.5.2 ---
* Codes optimized.
* New module: help.py
* The functions get_scaler, get_preds, get_act_pot, get_weights, and get_acc in the plan module have been moved to the model_operations module.
* The name of the 'learner' function in the 'planeat' module has been changed to 'evolve'.

--- UPDATE 2.5.1 ---
* The bug in the draw_model_architecture functionality of the save_model function in the model_operations module has been fixed.

--- UPDATE 2.5.0 ---
* Description and tutorials update, no big change.

--- UPDATE 2.4.9 ---
* Dependencies update, no big change.

--- UPDATE 2.4.8 ---
* Code improvements and security update, small changes no big change.

--- UPDATE 2.4.7 ---
* Three new hyperparameters were added to the learner function in the planeat module: 'activation_selection_add_prob', 'activation_selection_change_prob', and 'activation_selection_rate'. Details are available in the docstring and the updated documentation.
* Bug fixes in the planeat module.
* The cross_over function in the planeat module was optimized.
* The default values of the 'activation_add_prob' and 'activation_delete_prob' hyperparameters in the learner function of the planeat module have been changed to 0.5.

--- UPDATE 2.4.6 ---
* Doctrings updated.

--- UPDATE 2.4.5 ---
* Bug fixes in planeat module.
* planeat modules learner function have new hyperparameters:
  - activation_add_prob=0.9, activation_delete_prob=0.1, activation_change_prob=0.5, weight_mutate_prob=1, weight_mutate_rate=32

--- UPDATE 2.4.3 ---
* Bug fix in planeat module for 'cross_over_mode' hyperparameter.

--- UPDATE 2.4.2 ---
* A new hyperparameter called 'cross_over_mode' has been added to the learner function in the planeat module.
* More PLAN-like features have been added in planeat module. These are some of the weight features used for non-linearity of the PLAN algorithm to create more powerful models.

--- UPDATE 2.4.1 ---
