   """
   Initializes a population of genomes, where each genome is represented by a set of weights 
   and an associated activation function. Each genome is created with random weights and activation 
   functions are applied and normalized. (Max abs normalization.)

   Args:

      input_shape (int): The number of input features for the neural network.

      output_shape (int): The number of output features for the neural network.
      
      population_size (int): The number of genomes (individuals) in the population.

      dtype (numpy.dtype): Data type for the arrays. np.float32 by default. Example: np.float64 or np.float16. [fp32 for balanced devices, fp64 for strong devices, fp16 for weak devices: not reccomended!] (optional)

   Returns:
      tuple: A tuple containing:
         - population_weights (numpy.ndarray): A 2D numpy array of shape (population_size, output_shape, input_shape) representing the 
            weight matrices for each genome.
         - population_activations (list): A list of activation functions applied to each genome.
            
   Notes:
      The weights are initialized randomly within the range [-1, 1]. 
      Activation functions are selected randomly from a predefined list `all_activations()`.
      The weights for each genome are then modified by applying the corresponding activation function 
      and normalized using the `normalization()` function. (Max abs normalization.)

   """
   Applies the evolving process of a population of genomes using selection, crossover, mutation, and activation function potentiation.
   The function modifies the population's weights and activation functions based on a specified policy, mutation probabilities, and strategy.

   'selection' args effects cross-over.
   'mutate' args effects mutation.

   Args:
      weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of weights for each genome. 
         (first returned value of define_genomes function)
      
      activation_potentiations (list): A list of activation functions for each genome. 
         (second returned value of define_genomes function)
      
      what_gen (int): The current generation number, used for informational purposes or logging.
      
      fitness (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array containing the fitness values of each genome. 
         The array is used to rank the genomes based on their performance. PLANEAT maximizes or minimizes this fitness based on the `target_fitness` parameter.
      
      show_info (bool, optional): If True, prints information about the current generation and the 
         maximum reward obtained. Also shows the current configuration. Default is False.
      
      strategy (str, optional): The strategy for combining the best and bad genomes. Options:
         - 'normal_selective': Normal selection based on reward, where a portion of the bad genes are discarded.
         - 'more_selective': A more selective strategy, where fewer bad genes survive.
         - 'less_selective': A less selective strategy, where more bad genes survive.
         Default is 'normal_selective'.
      
      bar_status (bool, optional): Loading bar status during evolving process of genomes. True or False. Default: True

      policy (str, optional): The selection policy that governs how genomes are selected for reproduction. Options:
            
            - 'aggressive': Aggressive policy using very aggressive selection policy. 
                  Advantages: fast training. 
                  Disadvantages: may lead to fitness stuck in a local maximum or minimum.

            - 'explorer': Explorer policy increases population diversity.
                  Advantages: fitness does not get stuck at local maximum or minimum.
                  Disadvantages: slow training.
                  
                  Suggestions: Use hybrid and dynamic policy. When fitness appears stuck, switch to the 'explorer' policy.

            Default: 'aggressive'.
      
      fitness_bias (float, optional): Fitness bias must be a probability value between 0 and 1 that determines the effect of fitness on the crossover process. Default: 1.
      
      bad_genomes_mutation_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the bad genomes. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Also affects the mutation probability of the best genomes inversely. 
         For example, a value of 0.7 for bad genomes implies 0.3 for best genomes. Default: Determined by `policy`.
      
      activation_mutate_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the activation functions. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 1 (%100).
      
      cross_over_mode (str, optional): Specifies the crossover method to use. Options:
         - 'tpm': Two-Point Matrix Crossover.
         Default is 'tpm'.
      
      activation_mutate_add_prob (float, optional): The probability of adding a new activation function to the genome for mutation. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_delete_prob (float, optional): The probability of deleting an existing activation function 
         from the genome for mutation. Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_change_prob (float, optional): The probability of changing an activation function in the genome for mutation. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      weight_mutate_prob (float, optional): The probability of mutating a weight in the genome. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 1 (%100).
      
      weight_mutate_threshold (int): Determines max how much weight mutaiton operation applying. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 16

      activation_selection_add_prob (float, optional): The probability of adding an existing activation function for crossover.
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5. (WARNING! Higher values increase complexity. For faster training, increase this value.)
      
      activation_selection_change_prob (float, optional): The probability of changing an activation function in the genome for crossover. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_threshold (int, optional): Determines max how much activation mutaiton operation applying. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 2
      
      activation_selection_threshold (int, optional): Determines max how much activaton transferable to child from undominant parent. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 2

      dtype (numpy.dtype, optional): Data type for the arrays. Default: np.float32. 
         Example: np.float64 or np.float16 [fp32 for balanced devices, fp64 for strong devices, fp16 for weak devices: not recommended!].

   Raises:
      ValueError: 
         - If `policy` is not one of the specified values ('aggressive', 'explorer').
         - If 'strategy' is not one of the specified values ('less_selective', 'normal_selective', 'more_selective')
         - If `cross_over_mode` is not one of the specified values ('tpm').
         - If `bad_genomes_mutation_prob`, `activation_mutate_prob`, or other probability parameters are not in the range 0 and 1.
         - If the population size is odd (ensuring an even number of genomes is required for proper selection).
         - If 'fitness_bias' value is not in range 0 and 1.

   Returns:
      tuple: A tuple containing:
         - weights (numpy.ndarray): The updated weights for the population after selection, crossover, and mutation. 
                                    The shape is (population_size, output_shape, input_shape).
         - activation_potentiations (list): The updated list of activation functions for the population.

   Notes:
      - **Selection Process**: 
         - The genomes are sorted by their fitness (based on `fitness`), and then split into "best" and "bad" halves. 
         - The best genomes are retained, and the bad genomes are modified based on the selected strategy.
         
      - **Crossover Strategies**:
         - The **'cross_over'** strategy performs crossover, where parts of the best genomes' weights are combined with other good genomes to create new weight matrices.
         
      - **Mutation**:
         - Mutation is applied to both the best and bad genomes, depending on the mutation probability and the `policy`.
         - `bad_genomes_mutation_prob` determines the probability of applying mutations to the bad genomes.
         - If `activation_mutate_prob` is provided, activation function mutations are applied to the genomes based on this probability.
         
      - **Population Size**: The population size must be an even number to properly split the best and bad genomes. If `fitness` has an odd length, an error is raised.
      
      - **Logging**: If `show_info=True`, the current generation and the maximum reward from the population are printed for tracking the learning progress.

   Example:
      ```python
      weights, activation_potentiations = planeat.evolver(weights, activation_potentiations, 1, fitness, show_info=True, strategy='normal_selective', policy='aggressive')
      ```

      - The function returns the updated weights and activations after processing based on the chosen strategy, policy, and mutation parameters.

    and weights depending on whether reinforcement learning mode is enabled or not.

    Args:
        x_population (list or numpy.ndarray): A list or 2D numpy array where each element represents
                                               a genome (A list of input features for each genome, or a single set of input features for one genome (only in rl_mode)).
        weights (list or numpy.ndarray): A list or 2D numpy array of weights corresponding to each genome 
                                         in `x_population`. This determines the strength of connections.
        activation_potentiations (list or str): A list where each entry represents an activation function 
                                                or a potentiation strategy applied to each genome. If only one 
                                                activation function is used, this can be a single string.
    Returns:
        list: A list of outputs corresponding to each genome in the population after applying the respective 
              activation function and weights.

    Example:
        ```python
        outputs = evaluate(x_population, weights, activation_potentiations)
        ```

    - The function returns a list of outputs after processing the population, where each element corresponds to
      the output for each genome in `x_population`.

    Performs mutation on the given weight matrix and activation functions.

    Notes:
        - Weight mutation:
            - Each weight has a chance defined by `weight_mutate_prob` to be altered by adding a random value 
              within the range of [0, 1].
        - Activation mutation:
            - If `activation_mutate_prob` is triggered, one or more activation functions can be added, removed, 
              or replaced based on their respective probabilities (`activation_add_prob`, `activation_delete_prob`, 
              `activation_change_prob`).
        - The mutation probabilities should be chosen carefully to balance exploration and exploitation during 
          the optimization process.
