ABOUT ANAPLAN:

Anaplan is a machine learning library written in Python for professionals, incorporating advanced, unique, new, and modern techniques. Its most important component is the PLAN (Potentiation Learning Artificial Neural Network).
Both the PLAN algorithm and the Anaplan library were created by Author, and all rights are reserved by Author.
Anaplan is free to use for commercial business and individual users.
As of 08/21/2024, the library includes only the PLAN module, but other machine learning modules are expected to be added in the future.

Anaplan includes Plan Vision, NLPlan, and at the between of both, Deep Plan:<br>

HOW DO I IMPORT IT TO MY PROJECT?

Anaconda users can access the 'Anaconda Prompt' terminal from the Start menu and add the necessary library modules to the Python module search queue by typing "pip install anaplan" and pressing enter. If you are not using Anaconda, you can simply open the 'cmd' Windows command terminal from the Start menu and type "pip install anaplan". (Visual Studio Code reccomended) After installation, it's important to periodically open the terminal of the environment you are using and stay up to date by using the command "pip install anaplan --upgrade". The latest version was “1.0.1” at the time this document was written
•
After installing the module using "pip" you can now call the library module in your project environment. Use: “from anaplan import plan”. Now, you can call the necessary functions from the plan module.

MAIN FUNCTIONS:

The functions of the Anaplan modules, uses snake_case written style

1. fit (2Args - 8Args)
2. evaluate (5Args -6Args)

18. plot_decision_space (2Args)
19. standard_scaler(1Args - 3Args)
20. manuel_balancer(3Args)
21. weight_normalization (2Args)

The PLAN algorithm will not be explained in this document. This document focuses on how professionals can integrate and use Anaplan in their systems. However, briefly, the PLAN algorithm can be described as a classification algorithm. PLAN algorithm achieves this task with an incredibly energy-efficient, fast, and hyperparameter-free user-friendly approach.
